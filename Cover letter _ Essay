My first interest was in product design while I was younger, and ever since I have always been a creative person, and I am fascinated by the many opportunities for web designing that can improve people’s lives.
I believe I deserve this opportunity because I love to express myself through web designing .I will use the same designing mindset to deliver my job  with a focus in Web Design.

However, in my career in recent years I have been yearning to learn Web development and continue onto more advanced courses related to web development and design. This is what leads me to your job application. By this I hope to broaden my vision while honing my skills, learning in a multicultural environment and soaking up the inspiration from the diverse people. With my previous training and experience, I believe that I will be a good fit for your program.

Dear Mr. Mulligan,

I see you are in the market for a Front End Developer for your company’s satellite here in Westchester County. I have a strong background in this field and would welcome the chance to bring those skills to your projects.

I have been a valuable asset as a front end developer for both MicroShift and Kiwi using emerging technology to design websites and related materials. I am proficient in JavaScript CSS C++ AJAX and have robust HTML skills. Included in my front end developer skill set are a range of tools and resources for building landing pages tracking and analysis of websites conducting split tests catching and correcting errors before content goes live and more. In addition to writing and correcting front end coding I am familiar with the technical specifications for designing prototypes and guides. I have operated both independently and on teams both onsite and mobile. Juggling an entire project or working alongside others has honed time management skills for effective planning and organization estimating budgets and completing tasks on deadline every time.

I have attached my resume for your review and would appreciate the opportunity to schedule a teleconference to discuss the particulars of your Front End Developer position and what I bring to the table.

My experience so far as been evolving.  The orentation has been really enlightening, it has has broaden my knowlege about the various aspect of technology.
It has taught me about the challenges of working with a large no of people.I've been are exposed to team members with different backgrounds, needs, perspectives and thinking styles.
I've seen how a group is organized around a team structure –  supervising a team of people who work together toward common goals.
 I've seen how poeple learn to actively help and listen to others’ ideas and compromise when those ideas conflict with their own interests.
 
I have come to understanding that in a team environment, members of the team are expecting to make their deadlines. I've experience how to manage time and keeping up with multiple priorities.  
I really appreciate the prompt way the mentors are helping to answer questions from participants and giving clarifications its been encouraging. Also the game section has helped to structure the platform and help to understand and give attention to details.
 So far my experience as been inspiring,from the welcoming email throught the slack signup to the oreintaion and LMS registration.
I have also learned more features on the slack platform.I hope to get more exposure in my field and pull through to the end of this program.

Time Management and Organization
Work experience is the best training when it comes to managing time and keeping up with multiple priorities. Workers who have dealt with deadline pressure and lengthy to-do lists are more likely to have developed personal strategies that make them more efficient. In addition, someone who has been expected to negotiate lots of active projects should have a system of organization that works for them. They have learned to filter incoming information, determine what’s important or actionable, and manage correspondence in a timely manner.

Problem Solving
Employees with work experience have encountered their share of bumps in the road and are more likely to know how to mitigate problems before they derail day-to-day operations. Work experience teaches workers to address problems earlier rather than later and to take ownership of them -- seeing the solution through to the end. When a problem requires an outside-the-box solution, someone with experience knows how to gather the stakeholders to brainstorm creative approaches to the problem. An experienced employee also understands that the first idea may not be the one that works and that failure may mean returning to the drawing board.
