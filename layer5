@Bukola Kehinde you might confirm that gatsby-cli is installed and available by running which gatsby-cli

Then, clear out your local environment to ensure that you’re starting fresh:
This happens sometimes when there are some files cached. You can follow the following steps to solve it:
Clear the cache.
$ npm cache clean --force

Delete the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file. You could do that by navigating to the project folder or using the following command:

$ rm -rf node_modules && rm package-lock.json

Then, make setup-libs and make site.
