Instalment plans for self-funded students
If you are a self-funded student and need support spreading the cost of your tuition, we now offer an instalment plan for many of our courses.

Please note, this option is not available for students studying our Graduate Certificate or courses shorter than one year as full fees must be paid before your CAS is issued for these programmes. Instalment plans are not available to students in conjunction with our full fee payment discount.

Step 1: When you make an application to study with us, you must request an instalment plan in writing by emailing London.admissions@northumbria.ac.uk – we will store this against your application record and include the information in your unconditional offer letter.

Students without an instalment plan in their unconditional offer letter will not be offered this option.

Step 2: Once you have an offer to study with us, you are required to pay a minimum deposit of £5,500 prior to your CAS being issued. This must be paid in advance of our advertised CAS deadlines.

Step 3: Pay the remaining fee balance in a further 3 equal instalments (an instalment plan) during the first semester of your course and before the below payment deadlines.

Course start	   1st instalment deadline	2nd instalment deadline	3rd instalment deadline
January             	28 Feb	                   31 March	             30 April
May or June	            30 June	                   31 July	             31 Aug
September or October	31 Oct	                   30 Nov	             15 Dec
Students who fail to meet the payment dates and flexibility offered by the instalment plan risk their right to attend their course and be sponsored to study in the UK.
