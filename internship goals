Goals as a frontend intern

----what do I want to achieve through Hng intership by the end of 8 weeks 

A reflection on my goals allows me to give a deeper insight into how this internship fits in with my long-term career goals.

The opportunity to participate in Hng internship is been organised by Zuri Team which has been immensely successful in creating a global network of a highly adept intelligent 
workforce that help companies achieve their mission-critical projects and goals.

In answering this question, I'm going to tailor it down to what employers are looking for. This will help me to prepare my skills as needed in the job market.
When an employer hires someone, they don’t want that person to be short term; they want the employee to be there for a long time. 

As a Front End Developer my main goal is to combine technology and design to create inviting, easy-to-use websites for consumers. 
In order to accomplish this goal i intend to accomplish the following within the next 8 weeks through this internship:

To develop Proficiency in website programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to build real-life businesses
To build a network of relationship with other developers
To learn how to maintain workflow using project management tools(like GitHub) with a team.
To remain focused on tasks for long periods of time
To improve my technical skills and interpersonal skills

Hi team founders,
 Im Derek, a mobile developer with flutter, I've done some projects as well as developed some apps for some clients on freelancing sites like(fiverr.com, upwork.com ). 
I'll just give you the brief part if you'd find the story too long- I'm a mobile app developer with django and react experience and  knowledge on graphics, been and still a freelancer on Fiverr and upwork.
GitHub.com/derekzyl  , behance.net -derek Og
My portfolio site cybergenii.com 
Username on all professional sites : derekzyl
Username on stack overflow: cybergenii


  My journey into tech started with graphics design and I did banners, logos and flyers for startups and various firms, my works is on behance.net( username:derek Og).   
    Then I migrated to programming with a resolution to stick to using reactjs for frontend jobs; my website cybergenii.com was fully developed with reactjs aside developing apps for some clients uniqueebc.com, as well as others that I can't disclose because of signed agreements. 
    Then I proceeded to learn Django to complement backend development. I've done some jobs like stockbro.pythonanywhere.com (downgraded because from coinminfx.com of bridge of contract), globalcoinsfx.com and others I still can't mention 
   And GitHub.com/derekzyl got a little story to tell about my journey thus far but I got bunch of private repositories and guess you know why it's private.


For the portfolio app: https://appetize.io/app/kqq580pb8knf0v6b60vmhuk28r?device=nexus5&scale=75&orientation=portrait&osVersion=8.1 this is the URL 
I've had some experience working with teams to develop mobile food delivery app like eazzy eats which is currently on playstore and currently on a rider app with some team of developers.


It will be a pleasure to take over the world together. Hoping to work with your teams
